# pandas-challenge
For TCC-VIRT-DATA-PT-10-2022-U-LOLC-MTTH

In this assignment, youâ€™ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for this homework assignment and name it PyCitySchools.

Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.

Instructions
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Hint: Check out the sample solution called PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb located in the .zip file to review the desired format for this assignment.

District Summary
Create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame, including the following:

Total schools

Total students

Total budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary
Create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, including the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Create a DataFrame that highlights the top-5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Create a DataFrame that highlights the bottom-5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Math Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). Use your judgment to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. Include the following metrics in the table:

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Scores by School Size
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

Scores by School Type
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school type (district or charter).
